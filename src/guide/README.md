# About

GooseMod is a innovative, modern, and community-driven modification to the [Discord](https://discord.com) client. This documentation site hopes to provide you, and other module developers, with the information to make your own modules for the built-in Module Store; which allows users to easily import modules in one click whilst also protecting them from malicious plugins and developers, as all code is audited.
