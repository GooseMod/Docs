# Ports

If you are reading this you have likely been asked for permission to add your already existing theme or plugin to GooseMod. This page was added as a quick answer to most questions and to help provide basic information.


## What is GooseMod?

GooseMod is a new (started development in October) Discord mod, designed quite differently than other mods. The primary difference being that users install themes and plugins via a built-in store, rather than using the filesystem / downloading another way. [You can find out some more information about GooseMod by looking at our main site](https://goosemod.com). Here you can see a screenshot of the Store's UI in GooseMod:

In terms of rough statistics for GooseMod:
  - Over 8000 total users
  - Over 510 members in GooseMod's Discord
  - Over 50 original modules for GooseMod
  - Over 6 original GooseMod developers in the Module Store
  - Over 45 ported developers (developers who had their themes / plugins added) in the Module Store


## What's the process?

As long as your:
 - Theme: supports *BetterDiscord*, *Powercord*, or *Vizality*
 - Plugin: supports *Powercord*

Then it is as easy as just giving your explicit permission for it to be added to GooseMod's Store. We make sure we always get consent before adding any form of ported plugin or theme to the Module Store as we want to give developer's the full choice. You can change your decision at any time.
