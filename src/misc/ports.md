# Ports

If you are reading this you have likely been asked for permission to add your already existing theme or plugin to GooseMod. This page was added as a quick answer to most questions and to help provide basic information.


## What is GooseMod?

GooseMod is a new (started development in October) Discord mod, designed quite differently than other mods. The primary difference being that users install themes and plugins via a built-in store, called the Module Store, rather than using the filesystem / downloading another way. [You can find out some more information about GooseMod by looking at our main page](https://goosemod.com). Here you can see a screenshot of the Module Store UI in GooseMod:

In terms of statistics for GooseMod: (as of 2nd March 2021)
  - Over 6000 total users
  - ~200 members in GooseMod's Discord
  - Over 45 original modules for GooseMod
  - Over ~4 GooseMod developers in the Module Store
  - Over ~20 ported developers in the Module Store


## What's the process?

As long as your theme currently supports *BetterDiscord*, or *Powercord* it is as easy as just giving your explicit permission for it to be added to GooseMod's Module Store. We make sure we always get consent before adding any form of ported plugin or theme to the Module Store as we want to give developer's the full choice. You can change your decision at any time.
